This News Website is a responsive and dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It fetches the latest news articles from an external API and displays them in an organized and visually appealing layout. Users can browse through different categories such as National, Business, Sports, Technology, Entertainment, Science, and more. The project leverages AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) to asynchronously retrieve news articles without requiring a page refresh, ensuring a seamless user experience.
